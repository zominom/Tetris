🎮 TETRIS ON LEDS
A project that nobody asked for, but everybody needs.

🤔 What is this?
Ever thought:

"Wow, my expensive LED matrix is just too calm... what if it attacked my eyeballs with a game of Tetris?"

Well, you’re welcome.
This is a Tetris game, running on a tiny army of colored dots, controlled by your very serious Python app.

⚡ Features
Playable Tetris. (Yes, like the real thing. No, not like that weird 2003 bootleg you found once.)

Random colors for maximum chaos.

Rotating pieces that sometimes obey physics. Sometimes.

Lines disappear with dramatic flair.

LEDs scream in RGB while you pretend you have lightning-fast reflexes.

Extremely professional code. (Defined loosely.)

🎮 How to Play
Run the app.

Connect to your LED Matrix with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy, or "Bluetooth Let's-go-Eventually").

Press buttons to move shapes.

Cry when you realize Tetris is way harder without a screen bigger than 3 inches.

Blame the LEDs, not yourself.

🛠 Requirements
Python 🐍 (the language, not the snake)

A LED matrix you already emotionally bonded with

BLE support

Courage

Low expectations for life choices

📦 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-cool-led-tetris/tetris-led-matrix.git
cd tetris-led-matrix
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tetris_led.py
Boom. You're officially a game developer. 🎩

🧠 Behind the scenes
Pieces are built pixel by pixel because size matters.

Rotation sometimes respects the laws of physics.

Your BLE LED controller is being bullied by Python.

Every crash is a feature, not a bug.

🤡 Known Issues
Blocks may rotate into the void.

Timing is more of a suggestion than a rule.

It will probably crash if you win. (Highly unlikely though.)

Dog may eat your LED matrix. (No fix planned.)

PRs are welcome!
Just make sure they are either:

Funny

Useless

Or somehow make the LEDs blink faster

Imagine beautiful glowing chaos.
Now squint.
Now imagine even worse.
That's the screenshot.
