# üéÆ TETRIS ON LEDS  
_A project that nobody asked for, but everybody needs._

---

## ü§î What is this?

Ever thought:  
> "Wow, my expensive LED matrix is just **too calm**... what if it **attacked my eyeballs** with a game of Tetris?"

Well, **you‚Äôre welcome**.  
This is a **Tetris game**, running on a **tiny army of colored dots**, controlled by your **very serious** Python app.

---

## ‚ö° Features

- **Playable** Tetris. (Yes, like the real thing. No, not like that weird 2003 bootleg you found once.)
- **Random colors** for maximum chaos.
- **Rotating pieces** that sometimes obey physics. Sometimes.
- **Lines disappear** with dramatic flair.
- **LEDs scream** in RGB while you pretend you have lightning-fast reflexes.
- **Extremely professional code.** (Defined loosely.)

---

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Run** the app.
2. **Connect** to your LED Matrix with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy, or "Bluetooth Let's-go-Eventually").
3. **Press buttons** to move shapes.
4. **Cry** when you realize Tetris is way harder without a screen bigger than 3 inches.
5. **Blame the LEDs**, not yourself.
